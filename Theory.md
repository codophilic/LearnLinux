- It is reliable ,  fast and secure. We can create our own OS using based as Linux. 
- Mobile phone, self driving cars, electronic devices are majorly based on Linux. 
- Depending upon requirement OS selection is done like for development, majorly developers uses Linux whereas for gaming purpose windows is the better choice.

- Hardwares are your motherboard, microprocessor, disk etc.. which cannot connect with the user directly for any operations. 
- Kernel is the middle person which provides the conversation bridge for user and hardware. 
- Shell basically executes the command provided by application or user. 
- So let say if we want to copy a file using command, shell will interpret that copy command to kernel. Then kernel understand that operation and pushes it to the hardware in language which hardware understand like an assembly language or micro controller level language. So the hardware will perform the operation and sent back the response to the kernel which in turn returns on the shell which is view on monitor.
